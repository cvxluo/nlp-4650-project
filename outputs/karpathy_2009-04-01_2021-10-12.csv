GroupNorm, like all other members of the *norm zoo cannot be fused into Linear/Conv weights at test time for efficient inference and is therefore 100X less interesting.

Have you wondered why object detection, unlike classification, has so many sophisticated algorithms?

With Pix2Seq (http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10852), we simply cast object detection as a language modeling task conditioned on pixels!

I'm a bit old school, so I like single-player story-rich FPS-like experiences, looking forward to AoE4, and anything operations heavy like RimWorld/Factorio/Civ-like. I don't do free-to-play abominations or other multiplayers (except a bit of CS:GO/Valorant/Overwatch/etc)

(I experience this also with my gaming monitor, where I will take 240Hz over any resolution/graphics)

Had the same experience, I was on the fence about upgrading but went to the store to see the 120Hz in person. Suddenly my old phone (which seemed smooth) looked super obviously choppy, so I paid to make the pain stop
