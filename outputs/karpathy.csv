- random object ordering seems fine 
- coords, class labels flattened into a single softmax 
- sequence augmentation is the most gnarly part, almost as yucky as nms

Have you wondered why object detection, unlike classification, has so many sophisticated algorithms?

With Pix2Seq (http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10852), we simply cast object detection as a language modeling task conditioned on pixels!
