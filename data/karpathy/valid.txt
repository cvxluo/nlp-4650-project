<BOS> Yes, imo much performance of neural nets across the industry is becoming upper bounded by large-scale data to pre-trainfinetune from, not algorithms (they are largely knownpublished and often available as open source) or compute (available in cloud).

Object detection cast naively into language modeling framework + borrowing many of the tips&tricks. - random object ordering seems fine  - coords, class labels flattened into a single softmax  - sequence augmentation is the most gnarly part, almost as yucky as nms  Have you wondered why object detection, unlike classification, has so many sophisticated algorithms?

<BOS> That graduate student has got to have a lot of faith in his coding abilities. Also must be very motivating to get the model right :s <EOS>
<BOS> good post & links! Touches on gradient accumulation, gradient checkpointing (no, not the normal checkpointing), the nearly unambiguous superiority of distributed data parallel container in PyTorch, and the overall importance of understanding what's under the hood. I've spent most of 2018 training models that could barely fit 1-4 samplesGPU. But SGD usually needs more than few samplesbatch for decent results. I wrote a post gathering practical tips I use, from simple tricks to multi-GPU code & distributed setups: <EOS>
<BOS> Nature article released today: "An integrated map of genetic variation from 1,092 human genomes" <EOS>
<BOS> All this recent chess championship excitement has awoken my chess past and now I'm playing Blitz games until 5am again :'( <EOS>

<BOS> Hanging out at NVIDIA's #gtc16. Ironically their processing of VR demos is surprisingly serial <EOS>
<BOS> Many people were annoyed that stock supply of new iPhone 5S was very very low. Long camping and then sent home due to low supply <EOS>

<BOS> My grandma has actually never heard of Google...just blows my mind. I don't even know how to describe it to her, or where to start <EOS>
<BOS> Hmm. An app that lets you take picture of a mushroom and tells you if its poisonous. ( brainstorming some   #visionstartupideas ) <EOS>
<BOS> Ran a crossval of arxiv-sanity recommendation alg approachesparams. Increased Recall@20 from 0.25 to 0.31, i.e. probly works bit better now <EOS>
<BOS> Also learning a lot about where CNNs work and where they fail. That has been most interesting. Hoping to quantify and write it up nicely. <EOS>
<BOS> Ah crap... spent 6 hours playing Elder Scrolls and it's almost morning. I'm going to regret this tomorrow... <EOS>
<BOS> I think there are masses of naked, spray-painted undergrads running naked through the campus and yelling... I'm missing something here <EOS>
<BOS> Next up on my holiday reading list: "The China Study", a data-driven book on nutrition and diet <EOS>

<BOS> Saw The Martian. Did not disappoint, really enjoyed. Stayed close to book except skipped few of my fave parts (dust storm with no comms etc) <EOS>
<BOS> The new Google Currents ( looks like a Flipboard copy. I love Flipboard. This feels a bit like bullying again <EOS>
<BOS> One of favourite moments of yesterday: A friend's 10 minute rant about why Google Glass sucks... to person who turned out to work on it :D <EOS>
<BOS> Was about to tweet about how awesome The Lego Movie was and noticed Elon Musk shares my opinion :D That movie is on steroids! So good! <EOS>

<BOS> It's been a while since I last played Factorio, but I can't stop thinking about it, and of the entire economy as being an MMORPG version of it. Factory Town, RimWorld, Banished, Dawn of Man etc are all great too but somehow pack less long-term punch. <EOS>
<BOS> "My First Year as a Freelance AI Engineer"  fun read masatohagiwara.net My First Year as a Freelance AI Engineer This week marks my one-year anniversary of quitting my full-time job and becoming a freelance AI engineer.
