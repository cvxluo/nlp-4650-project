<BOS> This was imo a big problem with MSCOCO. Yes it's a lot of data but a third of it were savana animals and another third bathrooms. Strange <EOS>
<BOS> Straight forward progression. We first didn't learn anything. Then just the classifier. Then just the ConvNet params. Now also architecture. <EOS>

<BOS> Tweeted this while ago but I'll reshare REINFORCEjs  . Several fun Reinforcement Learning JS web demos I'm fond of :) <EOS>
<BOS> Various computational workloads exhibit different amounts of parallelism and are accordingly best scheduled on CPU or GPU. Same is true for human organizationsprojectstasks, but it seems rarely analyzed from that perspective. Compiling a project to run fast on people is hard :) <EOS>

<BOS> HATING the new youtube channels design. But they will force me to switch anyway... UGH! <EOS>
<BOS> Finding it increasingly hard to keep up with all of the activity in deep learning right now, as # tabs -> \infty and tab width -> 0. It hasn't even been a decade since AlexNet (~Sep 2012 => ~8.5yrs) and a lot happened. Another 8.5 will be ~2030, I wonder what that's like. <EOS>

<BOS> The internet is fucked  via  @verge  this is important. <EOS>
<BOS> It's interesting that deep nets seem to do much better on this task, I think. Also ex2:  a cat. Demo too addictive :\ <EOS>
<BOS> I think about this a lot; Our dependence hierarchy is large (and rapidly expanding), a system works at min() over its dependencies, and humans who understand little pieces of it constantly swap in and out. Doesn't just apply to code but to human organizations, supply chains, etc. Why today’s Facebook drama will keep happening, explained by @xkcd <EOS>

<BOS> Fun to follow Newsweek's article ( by Goodman that "identifies" Bitcoin's Satoshi - much evidence suggests it's wrong <EOS>
<BOS> I have a good idea - I'll just update my Ubuntu, how bad could it be. If you're using NVIDIA drivers, apparently very very bad. <EOS>

<BOS> I made some bets in 2001 on what 2020 (a crazy future at the time, two whole decades away) would be like. And now it’s here. As a very common theme I way over predicted a lot of physical and way under predicted a lot of digital. Maybe I can try better now for 2040 :) <EOS>
<BOS> woohoo! thanks :) great defense talk @karpathy, congratulations! <EOS>
<BOS> "Multi-Sample Dropout for Accelerated Training and Better Generalization"  fun idea: when using dropout before your last layer you might as well as sample multiple masks there, as doing so is so cheap compared to the forward pass. Appears to converge faster <EOS>
<BOS> (also don't miss link inside to the labeling interface, if you'd like to see GoogLeNet's predictions and compete against them yourself) <EOS>
<BOS> I forged very promising plans with friends over beers for beating fusion energy output yields with monkeys, bananas and bicycles. Stay tuned <EOS>

<BOS> I'm trying to chop down my NIPS paper from 12 to 8 pages. Just did one complete pass, and I'm now at 13 pages instead. #fail <EOS>
<BOS> Also Inception + ResNet combo now gives 3.08% top 5 error on ImageNet  just to put this in context, that's VERY LOW <EOS>
<BOS> 1 second every day app, now available! <EOS>
<BOS> I'm on a record with few people claiming its the best input device of the future, coupled with a Glass-like VR thing. So this better work ;p <EOS>
