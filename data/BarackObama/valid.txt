<BOS> Let’s be clear: This is a deliberate attempt to undermine our democracy by making it harder to vote. That’s why passing the For the People Act is so important, and why every one of us needs to keep up the fight. Our future depends on it.

This is voter suppression.  We need the Senate to pass the #ForThePeopleAct and protect voting rights! <EOS>
