Going forward “HW3” will just be called FSD Computer, which is accurate. No change to vehicle sensors or wire harness needed. This is v important. @elonmusk there's a lot of rumors going on about the HW3 and APH3 not being a free upgrade for those who purchased FSD. Can you please elaborate if this will indeed be a free upgrade for those who have FSD? Thanks so much! <EOS>

<BOS> Would be great to combine blood donations with a C19 antibody test, so you know if you’re immune. Refill blood banks & give donors peace of mind. Earlier this week, I visited @NIH to donate blood for patients who are involved in clinical trials. The #COVID-19 pandemic has created a blood and plasma shortage in America. If you are a healthy individual, please consider donating blood. One donation can save up to 3 lives. <EOS>
